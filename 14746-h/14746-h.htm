c&otilde;mytte it to my sone, I here them say, he wyll what so euer
you wyll. Shall I than alone bothe a woman and a mayd helpe
maryneres, sawdyeres, marchantmen, dyasseres, maryed m&ecirc;,
women with chyld, iudges, kynges, and husbondmen? ye and this that
I haue sayd is the least parte of my payne. But I am nat now so
moche trobled with soche busynes, for that I wold hartely thanke
you, but that this commodytye dothe brynge a greater
disc&otilde;modytye with hym. I <span class="pagenum">|</span> haue
now more ease, but lesse honor &amp; profett. Before this tyme I
was callyd quene of heuen, lady of the world, but now any man wyll
skarsly say aue Maria or hayle Mary. Before I was clothyd with
precyous stones and gold, and had my chaunges, and dayly ther was
offeryd gold and precyous stones, now I am skarsly coueryd with
halffe a gowne and that is all beeyten with mysse. My yerly rentes
be now so smalle y<sup>t</sup> I am skarsly able to fynde my pore
quere kepar to light a wax c&atilde;dle before me. Yet all this
myght be sufferyd, but you be abowt to pluke away greater thynges,
you be abowt (as they say) that what so euer any saynte hathe in
any place, to take hyt frome the churches, but take hede what you
doo. For ther is no saynte without a way to reu&ecirc;ge his
wronge. If you cast saynt Petre forthe of the churche, he may serue
<span class="pagenum">|</span> you of the same sauce, and shite vp
heuyngates ayenst you. y<sup>e</sup> saynt Paule hathe his sworde.
Barthylmew is nat w<sup>t</sup>owt his great knyffe. Saynt Wyllyam
is harnysyd vnder his monkes cloke, nat withowt a greate speare.
What canst thou doo ayenst saynt George whiche is bothe a knyght
&amp; all armyd with hys longe spere and his fearfull sword? Nor
saynt Antony is nat withowt hys weapenes for he hathe holy fyre
w<sup>t</sup> hym. Ye the rest of the sayntes haue theyr weapones
or myschefues, whiche they send apon whome they liste. But as for
me thou canst not cast owt, except thou cast owt my sone, whiche I
hold in myne armes. I wyll nat be seperat frome hym, other thou
shalt cast hym owt with me or els thou shalt let vs bothe be,
except that you wold haue a temple withowt a Christe. These be the
thynges that I wold <span class="pagenum">|</span> yow shall know

<p><b>Me.</b> I haue harde oft of saynt Iames, but I pray you

<p><b>Mene.</b> I am in a great doubt whether I shuld, rather
maruayle apon thayre wykyd boldnes, or Goddys great g&ecirc;tlenes
and longe sufferynge.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Ap&otilde; the Northe parte ther is a certayne
gaate, but lest that you should make a lye, it is nat of the
churche, but of the pale that compassithe a bowte the churche
yarde, and that hathe a lytle wykyt, suche as be in great mennes
gaates, that who so euer wyll entre, must fyrst putin hys legge,
nat withowt some ioperdie, and than bowe downe hys hedde.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> It is ioperdie to goo thorow suche a dore, to a
mannes enemye.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> So it is, the sexten dyd tell me that <span class=
"pagenum">B iii.</span> ther was ones a knyght whiche fleeynge hys
enemye, than aprochynge, dyd ride thorow y<sup>e</sup> wykyte, and
than the wretche dispayrynge in hym selffe, apon a soden motion,
dyd commend hymselffe to y<sup>e</sup> blessyd virgyne, whiche was
than at hand. But now commythe the myrakle. By and by that knyght
was all in the churche yarde, and hys aduersary was ragynge at the
dore wowte.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> And dyd he tell you so maruylous a myrakle for a
trewthe?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No dowte.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> But I suppose that he could nat so lyghtely doo that
to you so a great a philosopher.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> He dyd shewe to me in that same wykytte in a plate
of coper, the ymage of the knyght fastenyd with nayles and
w<sup>t</sup> the same garmentes y<sup>t</sup> the Englishmen were
wontyd to wayre at that tyme, as you may see in that olde pictures,
whiche wylnat lye, Barbours had <span class="pagenum">|</span> but
lytle lyuynge at that tyme: and dieres &amp; websteres gotte but
litle monay.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Why so?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> For he had a berd like a goote, and his cote had
neuer a plyte, &amp; it was so litle, that with strayte gyrdynge it
mayd hys body to apere lesse than it was. Ther was another plate,
that was in quantyte and fourme like to a cheste.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Well now it is nat to be doubtyd ap&otilde;.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Under y<sup>e</sup> wykyte ther was a grate of yrne,
that no man c&atilde; passe theryn but a footem&atilde;, for it is
nat conuenyent that any horsse shuld tread after apon y<sup>e</sup>
place, whiche the knyght dyd c&otilde;secrate to owr lady.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Nat withowt a good cause.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Frome that parte toward the Este, there is a litle
chapell, full of maruayles and thyther I w&ecirc;te, ther was I
receyuyd of another of our ladyes chaplenes, ther we knelyd downe,
to make our litle prayeres. By &amp; by, he broght forthe
<span class="pagenum">B iiii.</span> the ioynte of a mannes fynger,
the greatyste of thre, which I kyssyd, &amp; askyd whose relyques
thay were, he dyd say that thay were saynt Petres. What thapostle
sayd I. Ye sayd he. Than I dyd better beholde the ioynte, whiche
for hys greatenes myght well haue be a Gy&atilde;tes ioynte, rather
than a mannes. Than sayd I, saynt Peter must nedys be a great man
of stature. But at that word, ther was one of the gentlem&ecirc;
that stode by, that could not forbere lawghynge, for the which I
was very sory. For if he had holden hys pease, we had sene all the
relyques, yet we metely well pleasyd mayster Sext&ecirc;, with
gyuynge hym .ii. or .iii. grotes. Before that chapell there was a
litle howsse, which he sayd ones in wynter tyme whan y<sup>t</sup>
there was litle rowme to couer the reliques, that it was sodenly
broght &amp; sett in that place. Under that house <span class=
"pagenum">|</span> there was a couple of pittes, bothe fulle of
water to the brynkys, and thay say that y<sup>e</sup> sprynge of
thos pittes is dedicate to our lady, that water is very colde, and
medycynable for the hede ake and that hartburnynge.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> If that cold water wyll hele the paynes in the hede
and stomake, than wyll oyle put owte fyre from hensforthe.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> It is a myrakle that I tell, good syr, or els what
maruayle shuld it be, y<sup>t</sup> cowld water shuld slake
thurste?</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> This may well be one parte of your tale.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Thay say that the fowntayne dyd sodenly sprynge owte
of the erthe at the commaundement of our lady, &amp; I dilygently
examenynge althynges, dyd aske hym how many yeres it was sythe that
howsse was so sodenly broght thyther. Many yeres agone saythe he.
Yet, sayde I, the wallys doo nat apere so old. He dyd nat denay it.
No mor thes woden <span class="pagenum">B v.</span> pyleres. He
cowld nat denay but y<sup>t</sup> they were sette there nat longe
agoo, and also the mater dyd playnly testyfye y<sup>e</sup> same.
Afterward, sayd I, thys roffe which is all of rede dothe apere nat
to be very olde, &amp; he granted also, thes greete bemes which lye
ouerthwerte, and these rafteres that hold vpe that howsse were nat
sett longe agone. He affyrmyd my saynge. Well sayd I seynge that no
parte of the housse is lefte but all is new, how can yow say that
this was the house whiche was broght hyther so longe agoo.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I pray you how dyd the howskeper, auoyde hymselffe
frome your argum&ecirc;t.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> By &amp; by he dyd shew to vs the mater by the skyne
of a bayre whiche had hangyd be the rafteres a longe season, and
dyd almost moke the symplenes of owre wyttes that could nat
perceyue so manyfeste an argum&ecirc;te we beynge <span class=
"pagenum">|</span> perswadyd by this argument, askid pardon of our
ignorance, and callid into our communycacyon the heu&ecirc;ly mylke
of our lady.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> O how like to the sone is the mother, for he hath
left to vs so moche blood here in erthe, &amp; she so moche mylke,
that a man wyl skarysly beleue a woman to haue so moche mylke of
one chylde, in case the chyld shuld sukke none at all.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Thay saye the same of the holy crosse, whiche is
shewyd in so many places bothe openly, and pryuately, that if
y<sup>e</sup> fragmentes were gathered apon one heape, they wold
apere to be a iuste fraghte for a shipe, and yet Christe dyd bere
all his crosse hymselffe.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> But do nat you maruayll at this?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> It may welbe a str&atilde;ge thynge, but no
maruayle, seynge that the lord whiche dothe encreasse this at hys
pleasure, is almyghty.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> It is very gently expownded, but I am <span class=
"pagenum">|</span> afrayd, that many of thes be faynyd for
lukre.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> I suppose y<sup>t</sup> God wold nat suffre
hymselffe to be deludyd of suche a fasshion.</p>
<p><b>Mene.</b> Yis, haue nat you sene that wh&atilde; bothe the
mother, the sone, the father, and the holy ghoste hathe be robbyd
of thes sacrilegyous theues, that thay woldnat ones moue, or styre
nother with bekke or crakke wherby thay myght fray away the theues.
So great is the gentles of God.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> So it is, but here out me tale. This mylke is kepyd
apon the hye aultre, and in the myddys ther is Christe,
w<sup>t</sup> his mother apon hys ryght hand, for her honor sake,
the mylke dothe represente the mother.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> It may be sene than?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> It is closyd in crystalle.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> It is moyste th&atilde;?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> What tell you me of moystenes, wh&atilde; it was
mylkyd more than a thowsand and fyue hunthrithe yere agone, it is
so congelyd, that a m&atilde; wold <span class="pagenum">|</span>
saye that it were chalke temperyd with the whyte of a egge.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Ye, but do thay sette it forthe bare?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No, lest so holy mylke shuld be defowlyd with the
kyssynge of men.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> You say well. For I suppose y<sup>t</sup> ther be
many that kysse it, whiche be nother clene mouthyd, nor yet be pure
virgynes.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Whan y<sup>e</sup> sexten sawe vs, he dyd runne to
the aultre, &amp; put apon hym his surplese, &amp; his stole about
his nekke, knelyd downe relygyously, and worshipyd it, and
streghtforthe dyd offre the mylke to vs to kysse. And at the ende
of the aultre we knelyd downe deuoutly, &amp; the fyrste of all we
salutyd Christe, &amp; than after we callyd apon our lady with thys
prayer, whiche we had mayd redy for the same purpose. O mother
&amp; mayde, whiche dyd gyue sukke with thy virgynes teates the
lorde of heuen and yerthe, thy sone Iesus Christe, we beynge
puryfyed <span class="pagenum">|</span> thorowe hys precyous blode,
do desyre that we may attayne, and come to that blessyd infancye of
thy colombynes meknes, whiche is immaculate without malice, frawde,
or diseyte, and with all affectyon of harte dothe couett and stody
for the heuenly mylke of the euangelicall doctryne, to go forthe
and encrease with it into a perfaycte man, into the mesure of the
plentefulnes of Christe, of whose c&otilde;pany thou haste the
fruycyon, togyther with the father, &amp; the holy ghost for
euermore, so be it.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Uerely thys is a holy prayer. But what dyd she?</p>
<p><b>Ogygy.</b> Thay bothe bekkyd at vs, excepte my eyes waggyd,
and me thoght y<sup>t</sup> the mylke daunsyd. In the meanseson the
sexten came to vs, withowt any wordes, but he held out a table
suche as the Germanes vse to gather tolle apon bridges.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> By my trothe I haue cursyd veryofte suche
<span class="pagenum">|</span> crauynge boxes, whan I dyd ryde
thorowe Germany.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> We dyd gyue hym certayne monay whiche he offeryd to
our lady. Th&atilde; I axyd by a certayne yonge man, yt was well
learnyd, whiche dyd expownde and tell vs the saynge of ye
Sext&ecirc;, hys name (as fere as I remembre) was Robert alderisse,
by what tokenes or argum&ecirc;tes he dyd know that it was the
mylke of owr lady. And that I very fayne, &amp; for a good purpose
desyred to knowe, y<sup>t</sup> I myght stope the mowthes of
certayne newfanglyd felowes, that be wotyd to haue suche holy
relyques in derysyon and mokage. Fyrst of all the Sexten
w<sup>t</sup> a froward cownten&atilde;ce wold nat tell, but I
desyryd the yong man to moue hym more instantly, but somwhat more
gently he so courtesly behauyd hymselffe, y<sup>t</sup> and he had
prayd owr lady herselffe <span class="pagenum">|</span> after
y<sup>t</sup> fashion, she wold nat haue be dysplesyd therwith. And
th&atilde; this mystycall chapleyn, as and if he had be inspyryd
with y<sup>e</sup> holy ghoste, castynge at vs a frounynge loke, as
&amp; if he wold haue shote at vs y<sup>e</sup> horryble
thonderbolte of the greate curse, what nede you (saythe he) to moue
suche questyones, whan yow see before your eyes so autentycall
&amp; old a table. And we were afrayd lest that he wold haue cast
vs out of the churche for heretykes, but that oure monay dyd tempte
hys greate furye.</p>
<p><b>Mene.</b> What dyd you in the meaneseason?</p>
<p><b>Ogygyus.</b> What suppose you? We were amasyd as and if a man
had stryke vs with a clube, or we had be slayne with a
thonderclape, and we very lowly axid pardon of oure folishe
boldenes, and gote vs frome thens. For so must we entreate holy
thynges. <span class="pagenum">|</span> Frome thens we went in to
y<sup>e</sup> howse where owre lady dwellithe, and whan we came
there, we sawe another Sexten whiche was but a noues, he lokyd
famylarly as and if he had know&ecirc; vs, and wh&atilde; we came a
litle further in, we sawe another, y<sup>t</sup> lokyd moch after
suche a fashion, at the last came the thyrd.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Perauenture thay desyryd to descrybe you.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> But I suspecte another mater.</p>
<p><b>Mene.</b> What was it?</p>
<p><b>Ogygy.</b> There was a certayne theffe y<sup>t</sup> had
stole almost all owr ladyes frontlet, and I supposyd y<sup>t</sup>
they had me in suspycyon thereof. And therfore whan I was within
the chapell I mayd my prayers to our lady after thys fashi&otilde;.
Oh cheffe of all women Mary the mayd, most happy mother, moste pure
virgyne, we vnclene, and synners, doo vysyte the pure &amp; holy,
and after our abylytye we haue offeryd vnto the, we pray thy that
thy <span class="pagenum">C.</span> sone may grante this to vs,
that we may folow thy holy lyffe, and that we may deserue thorow
the grace of the holy ghoste, spirytually to c&otilde;ceyue the
lord Iesus Christ, &amp; after that conceptyon neuer to be separat
from hym, Amen. This done I kyssyd the aultre, and layd downe
certayne grotes for myne offerynge and went my waye.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> What dyde our lady now, dyd nat she make one sygne,
that you myght know that she had hard youre prayeres.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> The lyght (as I told you before) was but litle, and
she stode at the ryght ende of the aultre in the derke corner, at
the last the communicaty&otilde; of the fyrst Sexten had so
discoregyd me, that I durst not ones loke vpe with myne eyes.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> This pylgremage came but to smale effecte.</p>
<p><b>Ogy..</b> Yes, it had a very good &amp; mery ende.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> You haue causyd me to take harte of grasse, for (as
Homere <span class="pagenum">|</span> saythe) my harte was almost
in my hose.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Whan dynar was done, we returnyd to y<sup>e</sup>
temple.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Durste you goo &amp; be susspecte of felonye?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Perauenture so, but I had nat my selffe in
suspici&otilde;, a gyltles mynde puttythe away feare. I was very
desyrous to see that table whiche the holy Sexten dyd open to vs.
At the last we fownde it, but it was h&atilde;gyd so hye that very
fewe could rede it. My eyes be of that fashion, that I can nother
be callyd <span class="sidenote"><img src="images/flower_right.png"

nother purre blynd. And therefore I instantly desyryd Alldryge to
rede it, whose redynge I folowyd with myne owne eyes, because I
wold skarsly truste hym in suche a mater.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Well, now all doubtes be discussyd.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> I was ashamyd that I doubtyd so moche, y<sup>e</sup>
mater was so playne set forthe before oure eyes, bothe the name,
the place, the thynge it selffe as it was <span class="pagenum">C
ij.</span> done, to be breffe,there was nothynge lefte owte. There
was a mane whos name was Wylyam whiche was borne in Parise, a man
very deuoute in many thyngs but pryncypally excedynge relygyous in
searchynge for the relyques of all sayntes thorowowt all the world.
He after that he had vysytyd many places, contrayes, and regyones,
at the laste came to C&otilde;stantynenople. For Wylhelmes brother
was there byshope, whiche dyd make hym pry to a certayne mayde,
whiche had professyd chastyte, that hadde parte of oure ladyes
mylke, which were an excedynge precyous relyque, if that other with
prayer, or monaye, or by any crafte it myghte be gotte. For all the
reliques that he hadde gotte before were but tryfles to so holy
mylke. Wyllyam wold not rest there tyll that he had gotte halffe of
that holy mylke, but whan he had <span class="pagenum">|</span> it,
he thoghte that he was richer than Croeseus.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Why nat, but was it nat withowt any goodhope?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> He went th&atilde; streght home, but in hys iornay
he fell seke.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Iesu there is nothynge in thys worlde y<sup>t</sup>
is other permanent, or alwayes in good state.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> But whan he sawe &amp; perceyuyd that he was in
greate ioperdye of his lyffe, he callyd to him a frenchman, whiche
was a very trusty companyon to hym in hys iornay. And commaundyd
all to auoyd the place, and make sylence, &amp; pryuyly dyd betake
to hym thys mylke, apon this condycy&otilde;, that if it
ch&atilde;cyd to come home saffe &amp; sownde he wuld offre that
precyous tresure to our ladyes aultre in Paryse, whiche standythe
in the myddys of the ryuere Sequana, whiche dothe apere to separat
hymselffe to honor and obaye our blessyd lady. But to make short
tale. Wylyam is deade, &amp; <span class="pagenum">C iij.</span>
buryed, the Frenchman mayd hym redy to departe apon hys iornay,
&amp; sod&ecirc;ly fell seke also. And he in great dyspayre of
amendynge, dyd commyth y<sup>e</sup> mylke to an Englishm&atilde;,
but nat withowt great instance, and moche prayer he dyd that whiche
he was mouyd to doo. Than dyed he. And y<sup>e</sup> other dyd take
the mylke, and put it apon an aultre of y<sup>e</sup> same place
the Chanones beynge present, whiche were yt as we call Regulares.
Thay be yet in the abbaye of saynt Genofeffe. But y<sup>e</sup>
Englishm&atilde; obtaynyd the halffe of that mylke, &amp; caryed it
to Walsyng&atilde; in England, the holy ghost put suche in hys
mynde.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> By my trothe this is a godly tale.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> But lest there shuld be any doubte of this mater,
y<sup>e</sup> Byshopes whiche dyd grante pardon to it thayre names
be wryten there, as thay came to vysyte it, nat withowt thayre
offerynges, and thay haue <span class="pagenum">|</span> gyuen to
it remyssyon, as moche as thay had to gyue by thayre authorite.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> How moche is that?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Fowrty dayes.</p>
<p><b>Mene.</b> Yee is there dayes in hell.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Trewly ther is tyme. Y<sup>e</sup> but whan thay
haue gr&atilde;tyd all thayre stynte, thay haue no more to
grante.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> That is nat so for whan one parte is gone another
dothe encrease, and it chansythe dyuersly euyn as the tonne of
Canaidus. For that althoghe it be incontynently fyllyd, yet it is
alway emptye: and if thou be takynge owt of it, yet there is neuer
the lesse in the barell.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> If thay gr&atilde;te to an hunderithe thowsand
m&ecirc; fowrty dayes of pardone, wuld euery man haue elyke?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No doubte of that.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> And if any haue forty byfore dynar, may he axe other
forty at after souper, is there any thynge left than to gyue
him?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Ye, &amp; if thou aske it ten tymes in one
howre.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I wold <span class="pagenum">C iiij.</span> to God
that I had suche a pardon bagge, I wold aske but .iii. grotes, and
if thay wold flowe so faste.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Ye but you desyre to be to ryche, if y<sup>t</sup>
you myght for wyshynge, but I wyl turne to my tale, but there was
some good holy man whiche dyd gyue this argumente of holynes to
that mylke, and sayd that our Ladyes mylke whiche is in many other
places, is precyous &amp; to be worshipyd but thys is moche more
precyous, &amp; to be honoryd, bycause the other was shauen of
stones, but this is the same that came out of the virgynes
brest.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> How kno you that?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> The mayd of C&otilde;stantynople, which dyd gyue it,
dyd saye so.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Perauenture saynt Barnard dyd gyue it to her.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> So I suppose. For wh&atilde; he was an old man, yet
he was so happy y<sup>t</sup> he sukkyd of y<sup>e</sup> same
mylke, that Iesus hymselffe sukkyd apon.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> But I maruayle why he was <span class=
"pagenum">|</span> rather callyd a hony sukker than a mylke sukker.
But how is it callyd oure ladyes mylke that came neuer owt of her
breste?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Yes it came owt at her breste, but perauenture it
light apon the stone y<sup>t</sup> he whiche sukkyd knelyd apon,
and ther was receyuyd, and so is encreasyd, &amp; by ye wyll of god
is so multyplyed.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> It is wel sayd.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Whan we had sene all thys, whyle that we were
walkynge vpe &amp; downe, if that any thynge of valure were
offeryd, so y<sup>t</sup> anybody were present to see thaym ye
Sextens mayd great haste for feare of crafty c&otilde;uay&ecirc;ce,
lokynge ap&otilde; thaym as thay wold eate thaym. Thay poynte at
hym with there fynger, thay runne, thay goo, thay come, thay bekke
one to an other, as tho thay wold speake to thaym that stand by if
thay durste haue be bold.</p>
<p><b>Mene.</b> Were you afrayd of nothynge there?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Yis I dyd loke <span class="pagenum">C v.</span>
ap&otilde; hym, lawghynge as who shold saye I wold moue him to
speake to me, at laste he cam to me, and axid me what was my name,
I told him. He axid me if yt were nat I that dyd hange vpe there a
table of my vowe writen in Hebrew, within .ii. yere before. I
confessid that it was y<sup>e</sup> same.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> C&atilde; you wryte hebrewe?</p>
<p><b>Ogygy.</b> No but all that thay c&atilde;nat vnderstond, thay
suppose to be Hebrewe. And than (I suppose he was send for) came
the posterior pryor.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> What name of worshipe is y<sup>t</sup>? Haue thay nat
an abbate?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Why so?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> For thay cannat speake Hebrew.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Haue thay nat a Bishope?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> What is y<sup>e</sup> cause?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> For oure lady is nat as yet so ryche, that she is
able to bye a crosse, &amp; a mytre, whiche be so deare,</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Yet at least haue thay nat a presedente?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No veryly. <ins class="correction" title=
"'Menedemus' not marked as speaker">What lettythe thaym?</ins></p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> That is a name <span class="pagenum">|</span>of
dygnyte and nat of relygy&otilde;. And also for that cause suche
abbayes of Chanones, doo nat receyue the name of an abbate, thay
doo call thaym maysters?</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Ye, but I neuer hard tell of pryor posterior
before.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Dyd you neuer learne youre gr&atilde;mere
before.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Yis I know prior posterior am&otilde;gst the
fygures.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> That same is it. It is he that is nexte to the
prioure, for there priour is posterior.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> You speake apon the supprioure.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> That same dyd entertayne me very gently, he told me
what greate labure had be abowt y<sup>e</sup> readynge of thos
verses, &amp; how many dyd rubbe thayr spectakles abowt thaym. As
oft as any old ancyent doctor other of deuynyte or of the lawe,
resorted thyder, by and by he was broght to that table, some sayd
y<sup>t</sup> thay were lettres of Arabia, some sayd thay were
faynyd lettres. Well <span class="pagenum">|</span>at the last came
one that redde the tytle, it was wryten in laten with greate
Romayne lettres, y<sup>e</sup> Greke was wryten with capytale
lettres of Greke, whiche at the fyrst syght do apere to be capytale
lat&ecirc; lettres, at thayr desyer I dyd expownde ye verses in
laten, tr&atilde;slatynge thaym word for word. But wh&atilde; thay
wold haue gyuyn me for my labour, I refusyd it, seynge that ther
was nothynge so hard that I wold not doo for our blessyd ladyes
sake, ye thogh she wold comma&ucirc;d me to bere this table to
Hierusal&ecirc;.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> What nede you to be her caryoure, seynge that she
hathe so many angelles bothe at her hedde and at her fette.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Than he pullid owt of hys purse a pece of wodde,
that was cutt owte of the blokke that our ladye lenyd apon. I
perceyuyd by and by thorow the smell of it, that it was a holy
thynge. Than whan I sawe so <span class="pagenum">|</span>greate a
relyque, putt of my cappe, and fel down flatte, &amp; very deuoutly
kyssyd it .iii. or .iiii tymes, poppyd it in my pursse.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I pray you may a man see it?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> I gyue you good leue. But if you be nat fastynge, or
if you accompanyed with yowre wyffe the nyght before, I conceyle
you nat to loke apon it.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> O blessed arte thou that euer thou gotte this
relyque.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> I may tell you in cowncell, I wold nat gyue thys
litle pece for all y<sup>e</sup> gold that Tagus hathe, I wyll sett
it in gold, but so y<sup>t</sup> it shall apere thorow a crystall
stone. And than the Supprioure wh&atilde; he sawe that I dyd take
the relyque so honorably, he thoght it shuld nat be lost, in case
he shuld shew me greater mysteries, he dyd aske me whether I hadde
euer sene our ladyes secretes, but at that word I was astonyed, yet
I durst nat be so so bold as to demande what thos <span class=
"pagenum">|</span>secretes were. For in so holy thynges to speake a
mysse is no small danger. I sayd that I dyd neuer se thaym but I
sayd that I wold be very glade to see thaym. But now I was broght
in, and as I had be inspired with the holy ghost, than thay lyghted
a couple of taperes, &amp; set forthe a litle ymage, nat couryously
wroght, nor yet very gorgeous, but of a meruelous
v<sup>ir</sup>tue.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> That litle body hathe smale powre to worke myrakles.
I saw saynt Christopher at Parise, nat a carte lode, but as moche
as a greate hylle, yet he neuer dyd myrakles as farre as euer I
herd telle.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> At our ladyes fette there is a precyous stone, whos
name as it is nother in Greke nor Laten. The Frenchem&atilde; gaue
it the name of a tode, bycause it is so like, that no man (althoghe
he be conynge) can set it forthe more lyuely. But so moche greater
is <span class="pagenum">|</span>the myrakle, that the stone is
litle, the fourme of the tode dothe nat apere, but it shynythe as
it were enclosyd within that precyous stone.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Perauenture they ymagyne y<sup>e</sup> symylytude of
a tode to be there, euyn as we suppose whan we cutte y<sup>e</sup>
fearne stalke there to be an egle, and euyn as chyldren (whiche
they see nat indede) in y<sup>e</sup> clowdes, thynke they see
dragones spyttynge fyre, &amp; hylles flammynge with fyre, &amp;
armyd m&ecirc; encownterynge.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No, I wold you shuld know it, there is no lyuynge
tode that more euyd&ecirc;tly dothe expresse hymselffe than it dyd
there playnly apere.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Hetherto I haue sufferyd thy lyes, but now get the
another that wyll beleue the, thy tale of a tode.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No maruayle Menedemus thogh you be so disposyd, for
all the world cannot make me to beleue yt, not &amp; all doctoures
of dyuynyte wold swere <span class="pagenum">|</span>it were trewe.
But that I sawe it with myne eyes, ye with thes same eyes, dyd I
proue it. But in y<sup>e</sup> meanseson me thynke you regard
naturall phylosophye but litle.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> why so, because I wyll nat beleue y<sup>e</sup> asses
flye?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> An do you nat se, how nature the worker of all
thynges, dothe so excell in expressynge y<sup>e</sup> fourme bewty,
&amp; coloure of thaym maruylously in other thynges, but pryncypaly
in precyous stones? moreouer she hathe gyuen to y<sup>e</sup> same
stones wonderouse vertu and str&ecirc;kthe that is almost
incredyble, but that experience dothe otherwyse testyfye. Tell me,
do you beleue that a Adamand stone wold drawe vnto him stele
w<sup>t</sup>owt any towchynge therof, and also to be se<u>p</u>ate
frome him ayen of hys owne accorde, excepte that yow had sene it
with yowre eyes.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> No verely, nat and if .x. Arystoteles wold perswade
me <span class="pagenum">|</span>to the contrarye.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Therfore bycause you shuld nat say thys were a lye,
in case you here any thynge, whiche you haue not sene prouyd. In a
stone callyd Ceraunia we see y<sup>e</sup> fashon of lightnynge, in
the stone Pyropo wyldfyre, Chelazia dothe expresse bothe the
coldnes and the fourme of hayle, and thoghe thou cast in to the
hote fyre, an Emrode, wyll expresse the clere water of the seye.
Carcinas dothe counterfayte ye shape of a crabfishe. Echites of the
serpente vyper. But to what purpose shuld I entreat, or inuestygate
the nature of suche thynges whiche be innumerable, wh&atilde; there
is no parte of nature nor in the elementes, nother in any lyuynge
creature, other in planetes, or herbes y<sup>e</sup> nature euyn as
it were all of pleasure hathe not expressyd in precyous stones? Doo
yow maruayle th&atilde; y<sup>t</sup> in thys stone at owre ladies
fote, <span class="pagenum">D.</span>is the fourme and fashon of a
tode.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I maruayle that nature shuld haue so moche lesure, so
to counterfayt the nature of althynges.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> It was but to exercyse, or occupye the curyosytye of
mannes wytte, and so at the lest wyse to kepe vs frome ydlenes, and
yet as thoghe we had nothynge to passe y<sup>e</sup> tyme with all,
we be in a maner made apon foles, apon dyesse, and crafty
iogeleres.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> You saye very truthe.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> There be many men of no smale grauytye, that wyll
say thys kynd of stones, if that you put it in vynagre, it wyll
swyme, thoge you wold thruste it downe with violence.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Wherfore do thay sette a tode byfore our lady?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Bycause she hathe ouercome, trode vnderfote,
abolyshyd all maner of vnclennes, poys&otilde;, pryde, couytousnes,
and all wordly affectyones that raygne in man.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Woo be to vs, that hathe so many todes in owre
hartes.</p>
<span class="pagenum">|</span>
<p><b>Ogygy.</b> We shal be purgyd frome thaym all, if we
dylyg&ecirc;tly worshipe owre lady.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> How wold she be worshipyd.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> The most acceptable honor, that thou canste doo to
her is to folowe her lyuynge.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> You haue told all at ones. But this is hard to brynge
to pass.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> You saye truthe, but it is an excellente thynge.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> But go to, and tell on as you begane.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> After thys to come to owre purpose, the Supprioure
shewyed to me ymages of gold and syluer, and sayd, thes be pure
gold, and thes be syluer and gyltyd, he told the pryce of euery one
of thaym, and the patrone. Whan I wonderyd, reioycynge of so
maruelous ryches, as was abowt our lady, than saythe the
Sext&ecirc; bycause I percayue, that you be so vertuously affecte,
I suppose it greate wronge, to hyde any thynge frome you, but now
you shall see the pryuytyes <span class="pagenum">D ij.</span>of
our lady, and than he pullyd owt of the aultre a whole world of
maruayles, if I shuld tell you of all, a whole daye wold nat
suffyse, &amp; so thys pylgremage chansyd to me most happy. I was
fyllyd euyn full withe goodly syghts, and I brynge also with me
this wonderous relyque, whiche was a tok&ecirc; gyuen to me
fr&otilde;e our lady.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Haue you nat it prouyd, what valewre your woden
relyque is on?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Yis, y<sup>t</sup> I haue, in a certayne Inne within
thys thre dayes, ther I fownde a certayne man y<sup>t</sup> was
bestraght of hys wytte, whiche shuld haue be bownde, but thys woden
relyque was put vnder hys nekke pryuyly, wherapon he gad a sadde

euer he was before.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> It was nat the phrenysy, but the dronk&ecirc;

<p><b>Me.</b> O blessyd pacyence of suche martyres.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> At our entre in, lord what a pryncely place dyd
apere vnto vs, where as euery m&atilde; that wyll may goo in.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Is there no maruayle to be sene.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Nothynge but the greate wydnes of the place, and a

one, and I suppose set there for no other purpose, but to be a olde
monum&ecirc;t or sygne, that in thos dayes there was no greate
superfluyte. There thay saye that thys blessyd martyr sayd his last
good nyght to our lady, wh&atilde; he shuld departe hensse. In

<p><b>Ogy.</b> I graunt, and therefore I axyd, forgyfnes of saynt

After <span class="pagenum">|</span>thes thus we were brought in to
y<sup>e</sup> reuestry, o good lorde what a goodly syght was ther
of vestm&ecirc;tes of veluet &amp; clothe of golde, what a some of
candlestykes of gold? We sawe ther saynt Thomas crosse staffe, ther
was se&ecirc; also a rede ouerlayed with syluer, it was but of a
smalle wyght, vnwrought, nor no longer then wold retch vnto a mans
mydgle.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Was ther no crosse?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> I sawe none at all, ther was shewed vs a robe of
sylke treuly, but sowed with cowrse threde, garnysshyd
w<sup>t</sup> nother gold nor stone. Ther was also a napkyn full of
swette blody, wher with saynt Thomas wypyd bothe hys nose and hys

kyssed gladely.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Be not these thynges showed to euery body?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> No for sothe good syr.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> How happened it that you were in so good credens,
that no se<span class="pagenum">|</span>cret thynges were hyd frome

<p><b>Ogy.</b> I was well acquyntede with the reuerende father
Gwylyame warham the archbyshope. He wrote .ii. or .iii. wordes in
my fauour.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I here of many that he is a m&atilde; of syngler
humanite.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> But rather thou woldest call hym humanite it selfe
if thou dydest well know hym. For ther is in hym soche lernynge, so
vertuouse lyffe, soche purenes of maneres, that a m&atilde; cowld
wyshe no gyfte of a <u>p</u>fayte Byshope in him, that he hathe
nat. Frome thens afterward we were ladde to greater thynges. For
behynde the hyghe aultre, we asc&ecirc;dyd as it were in to a
nother new churche, ther was shewed vs in a chapell the face of the
blessed man ouergylted and with many precyous stones goodly
garnysshed. A soden chaunse here had almost marred the matter and
put vs out of conceyte.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I tary <span class="pagenum">|</span>to knowe what

<p><b>Ogy.</b> Here my company&otilde; Grati&atilde; gote hym lytle

hym that sate by the hede, herke, he seyd, good father, is it true
that I here, y<sup>t</sup> saynt Thomas whyl he it lyued was
mercyfull toward y<sup>e</sup> poer people? That is very true
saythe he, and he beg&atilde; to tell greatly of his liberalyte and
compassyon that he shewede to the poer and nedy. Then sayd
Grati&atilde;: I thynke that affection and good mynd in him not to
be chaungyde, but y<sup>t</sup> it is now moche better. Unto this
graunted y<sup>e</sup> keper of the hede, agayn sayd he, then in as
moche as thys holy man was so gratyouse vnto y<sup>e</sup> poer,
whan he was yet poer, &amp; he hym selfe had nede of monay for
y<sup>e</sup> necessarys of hys body, thynke ye nat that he wold be
cont&ecirc;t, now that he is so ryche, and also nedethe

and destitute of all helpe, in case she askyd lycens, &amp; pryuyly
stole away a small porcyon of so greate riches, to sukkre her
howshold, as and if the shold haue it of one that wold other leane,
or gyue it to herre? And whan he wold nat answere that kepyd the
golden hedde, Gracyane, as he is som what hasty, I, saythe he, doo
suppose playnly, that this holy man wold be gladde, yf
y<sup>t</sup> she, now beynge deade, myght sustayne the necestiye
of pore people. But there mayster parson begone to frowne, &amp;

but that he gestyd as he was wontyd to doo, and stoppyd hys mouthe

<p><b>Mene.</b> Treuly I do greatly alow your goodly fashion, but
oftentymes ernestly I c&otilde;syder, by what meaynes they may be
ac&otilde;pted without faute &amp; blame, that bestow so moche
substance in buyldyng churchys, in garnysshynge, and enrychynge
them without all mesure. I thynke as touchyng the holy vestmentes,
&amp; the syluer plate of the temple ther ought to be gyuyn, to the
solempne seruys, hys dygnyte and comlynes, I wyll also that the
buyldyng of the churche shall haue hys maiesty decent and
<span class="pagenum">E.</span> conuenyent. But to what purpose
seruyth so many holy water pottes, so many c&atilde;dlestyckes, so
many ymages of gold. What nede there so many payre of organes (as
thay call them) so costely &amp; chargeable? For one payre can not
serue vs: what profyteth y<sup>e</sup> musicall criynge out in the
temples y<sup>t</sup> is so derely bought and payed for, whan in
the meaneseson our brothers and systers the lyuely temples of
Christe liynge by the walles/dye for hungre &amp; colde.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Ther is no vertuouse or wyse man, that wold nat
desyre a meane to be hadde in thes thynges. But in as moche as thys
euyl is growen and spronge vp of superstityon beyond mesure, yet
may it better be sufferde, specially when we consyder on the other

if a man take any thynge from thense. Fyrst of all it is taken
sacrylege, then they hold ther handes that were accustomed to gyfe,
besyde that morouer they be allured &amp; mouyde to robbynge &amp;

better syght to beholde a temple rychely adourned, as ther be some

<p><b>Me.</b> Yet we rede that Byshopes in tymes paste were

<p><b>Me.</b> Who is he? the abbot of the place?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> He werythe a mytre, he may spend so moche as an
abbot, he w&atilde;ted nothynge but y<sup>e</sup> name, and he is
called prior for this cause tharchebyshope is tak&ecirc; in the
abbotes sted. For in old tyme who so euer was archbyshope of
y<sup>e</sup> dyocese, the same was also a monke.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> In good faythe I wold be content to be namyde a
Camelle, if I myght spende yerely the rentes and reuennes of an

<p><b>Ogy.</b> Me semede he was <span class="pagenum">|</span>

y<sup>e</sup> monks stode ther aboute with greate reuerence, the

&amp; the autor of the gyfte, for the cheffe stonys were sent

<p><b>Ogy.</b> You gesse well, how beit exercyse &amp; vse helpeth

in to the crowdes. Our lady hathe ther an habitacyon, but somwhat

<p><b>Me.</b> What feared she?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Nothinge I trow, except theues. For I saw neuer any

At the last we were brought agayne in to the reuettry, there was
taken out a cofer couered with blacke lether, it was sett downe
apon the table, it was sett open, by and by euery body kneled downe
and worshipyd.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> What was in it?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Certayne torne ragges of lynnen clothe, many hauynge
yet remaynynge in them the token of the fylthe of the holy mannes
nose. With these (as they say) saynt Thomas dyd wype a way the
swett of hys face or hys neke, y<sup>e</sup> fylthe of hys nose, or
other lyke fylthynes with whiche mannes body dothe abownde. Then my
companyon Gratian, yet ones agayn, got hym but smalle fauour. Unto
hym an Englyshe man and of famylyare acquayntenance and besyde
that, a man of no smalle authorite, the Prior gaff gentylly one of
the lynn&ecirc; ragges, thynkynge to haue gyuen <span class=

But Gratian there with lyttle plea sede and content, not with out
an euydent synge of dyspleasure, toke one of them betwene hys
fyngers, and dysdaynyngly layd it down agayne, made a mocke and a
mow at it, after the maner of puppettes, for thys was hys maner, if
any thing lykede hym not, y<sup>t</sup> he thought worthy to be
despysede. Wher at I was bothe ashamed and wonderously afrayed. Not
withstondynge the Prior as he is a man not at all dull wytted, dyd
dyssemble the matter, &amp; after he had caused vs drinke a cuppe
of wyne, gentylly he let vs departe. When we came agayne to
London.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> What shuld y<sup>e</sup> do at Londo: seynge
y<sup>e</sup> were not farre from the see cost, to seale in to yowr

<p><b>Ogy.</b> It is true. But that see cost I refused and gladely
dyd fle from it, as from a place that is <span class=

stelynge, and vntrue dealynge, then is of dangerouse ioperdy in the
see, be that hyll Malea wher many shyppes be drowned &amp; vtterly
destroyed for euer. I wyll tell the what I dyd se the last passage,
at my commynge ouer. We were many caryed in a bote frome Calys
shore to go to the shyppe. Amongest vs all was a pour y&otilde;ge
m&atilde; of Fra&ucirc;ce, and barely appayrelled. Of hym he
demauuded halfe a grote. For so moche thay dow take and exacte of
euery one for so smalle a way rowynge. He allegede pouerty, then
for ther pastyme thay searched hym, plucked of his shoes, and
betwene the shoo and the soule, thay fownde .x. or .xii. grotes,
thay toke th&ecirc; from hym laughyng at the mater: mockinge and
scornyng the poer &amp; myserable Frenchman.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> What dyd y<sup>e</sup> fellow than?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b>What thyng dyd <span class="pagenum">E v.</span> he?
He wept.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Whether dyd they thys by any authoryte?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Suerly by the same authoryte that thay steyle and
pycke straungers males and bowgettes, by the whiche they take a way
mennes pursys, if they se tyme and place conuenyent.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I meruayll that they dare be so bold to doo soch a
dede, so many lokynge vpon them.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> They be so accustomed, that they thynk it well done.
Many that were in the shyp lokede owt and sawe it also, in the bote
were dyuerse Englyshe marchauntes, whiche grudged agaynst it, but
all in vayne. The botem&ecirc; as it had ben a tryflyng mater
reiosed and were glade that they had so taken and handelyd the
myserable Frenchman.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I wold play and sporte with these see theues, &amp;
hange them vpon the gallowes.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Yet of such both the shores swarme full. Here tell
me, I pray the. What <span class="pagenum">|</span> wyll great
m&ecirc; do, wh&ecirc; theues take vp&otilde; them to enterpryse
soch masterys. Therfore, herafter I had leuer go fourty myllys
aboute, th&ecirc; to go y<sup>t</sup> way, thoffe it be moche
shorter. Morouer euyn as y<sup>e</sup> goynge downe to hell, is
easy and leyght, but y<sup>e</sup> c&otilde;mynge frome thens of
greate dyffyculty, so to take shyppynge of this syde the see, is
not very easy, and the landynge very hard &amp; dangeroufe. Ther
was at London dyuerse maryners of Antwerpe, with them I purposed to
take the see.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> Hathe that c&ucirc;tre so holy maryners?</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> As an ape is euer an ape, I gra&ucirc;te, so is a
maryner euer a maryner: yet if thou compare them vnto these,
y<sup>e</sup> lyfe by robbynge, and pyllynge and pollynge, they be
angelles.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> I will remembre thy saynge, if at any tyme I be
dysposed to go and se Engl&atilde;de. But come agayne in to
y<sup>e</sup> waye, frome whens I broght the <span class=
"pagenum">E vi.</span> owt.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Then as we whent toward London not farre from
Canterbury, we came in to a great hollow and strayt way, morouer
bowyng so downe, with hyllys of eyther syde, that a man can not
escape, nor it cannot be auoyed, but he must nedes ryde that way.
Up&otilde; the lefte hand of the way, ther is an almes howse for
olde people, frome them runnyth on owt, as sone as they here a
horseman commynge, he casteth holy water vpon hym, and anone he
offereth hym the ouerlether of a shoo bownde abowte with an yerne
whope, wherin is a glasse lyke a precyouse stone, they
y<sup>t</sup> kysse it gyf a pece of monay.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> In soche a way I had leuer haue an almes howse of
olde folkes, then a company of stronge theues.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> Gratian rode vpon my lefte hande nerer the almes
howse, he caste holy water vpon hym, he toke it in worthe so so,
<span class="pagenum">|</span> when the shoo was proferred hym, he
asked what he ment by it, saythe he, it is saynt Thomas shoo. There
at he turned and was very angry, &amp; turned toward me: what
(saythe he) meane these bestes, that wold haue vs kysse
y<sup>e</sup> shoes of euery good man? Why doo they not lyke wyse
gyue vs to kysse the spottel, &amp; other fylthe &amp; dyrt of the
body? I was sory for the old m&atilde;, &amp; gaue hym a pece of
money to c&otilde;forthe hym with all.</p>
<p><b>Me.</b> In myn opyny&otilde; Gratian was not all together
angry with owt a good cause. If shoes and slyppers were kept for a
tok&ecirc; of sobre lyuynge, I wold not be moch dyscontent ther
w<sup>t</sup>, but me thynks it is a shame full fashyon for shoes,
slyppers, and breches to be offered to kysse to any man. If some
wold do it by there owne fre wyll, of a certene affecty&otilde; of
holynes, I thynke they were whorthy of pardon.</p>
<p><b>Ogy.</b> It were <span class="pagenum">|</span> better not to
thes thynges, if I may say as I thynke, yet owt of thes thynges
that cannat forthwith be amended, it is my maner if ther be any
goodnes thereyn, to take it out, and apply it to the best. In
y<sup>e</sup> meanseson that contemplacy&otilde; and light delited
my mynde, that a good m&atilde; is lykened to a shepe, an euyll man
to a benemouse best. The serpent after she is dede, c&atilde;
stynge no more, not withstondyng with her euyll sauour and poyson
she infecteth and corruptyth other. The shepe as l&otilde;ge as she
is a lyue norryseth with her mylke, clothet with her wolle, makyth
riche with her lambes, when she is deade she gyueth vs good and
profytable lether, and all her body is good meat. Euen so, cruell
men, gyuen all to the world, so longe as they lyue be vnprofitable
to all m&ecirc;, when they be deade, what with ryngyng of bellys,
and pompyouse <span class="pagenum">|</span> funeralles they greue
them that be on lyue, and often tymes vexe ther successours with
new exactyones. Good men of the other syde at all assais be
profytable to all men, and hurtfull to noo man. As thys holy man,
whyle he was yet alyue, by hys good example, hys doctryne, his
goodly exhortatyons prouokyd vs to vertuouse lyuynge, he dyd
c&otilde;fort the c&otilde;forthlesse, he helped y<sup>e</sup>
poure, ye and now that he is deade, he is in a maner more
profytable. He hathe buylded thys costly &amp; gorgeouse churche,
he hath caused greate authoryte thorough out all Englande vnto the
ordre and presthode. At y<sup>e</sup> last, thys pece of the show

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
